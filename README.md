# FeedMeAnime

### To be added
- Tab tooltips to give advice
- Tutorial of some kind, ideas:
	- Overlay on first load with a few screenshots? 
	- Help bubbles you can close once you have read them?
	- Certainly need to expand on the relation ship between full title, nickname and label
- Support more RSS feed specifics such as creating magnet links for nyaa's rss feed or trying to make something useful from crunchy rolls

### Possible new features
- Better Anime name mapping - instead of comparing string trying using indexof for each seperate word, forming rating based on how many words are found within a given title and then counting say 40%+ as a confirmed match
- Better serving of thumbnails - could be improved with said name mapping above but also could be helping server side if we cached when a user successfully has a thumbnail along with their anime result, for any users that don't have the thumbnail currently for that followed anime, because of a deformed or inaccurate anime name in regards to our current thumbnail identification process, that can be populated by association.
